# Installation

Using native and cross-compiler toolchains to build and install Urho3D library

## Requirements

First prepares the build environment by installing a compiler toolchain for your target platform, and the required build tools. The compiler can be GCC, Clang, MSVC, MinGW-w64, or the one bundled in the SDK like Android SDK, Emscripten SDK, etc. On Ubuntu you can easily prepare the build environment by installing the `build-essential` package, on Windows by installing Visual Studio IDE, and on macOS by installing Xcode IDE. However, for cross-compiling usually you have to download and install the corresponding SDK manually. Make sure at the minimum the build environment has these build tools installed:
- CMake
- Git
- Rake

Optionally these as well:
- ccache - for speeding up the build
- Doxygen and Graphviz - for building documentation
- Make or Ninja - for building with terminal/console

:::caution

Cross-compiling on Windows host requires MinGW-w64 to be installed too as it is required to build the host-tools on the fly while cross-compiling the library for the target platform.

:::

Although Urho3D project has included all required third-party libraries as source code, there may be system-level dependency packages that must be satisfied before Urho3D can be built from source successfully. The list below is by no mean comprehensive nor canonical, but it should be the minimal to get started.

:::note

This may change in the future when the project uses better package manager and Modern CMake. Ideally, the project should bootstrap itself with more ease than currently is.
